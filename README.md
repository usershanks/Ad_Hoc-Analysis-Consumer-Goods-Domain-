# Ad_Hoc-Analysis-Consumer-Goods-Domain

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.
However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts.
Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills.

# Task
1.    There are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
2.    Use SQL query to answer these requests. 
3.    The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence you need to create a presentation to show the insights.

### **SQL Concepts Used**

1. **SELECT, DISTINCT, WHERE Clause**  
   Extracted specific rows and filtered data to focus on relevant information while removing duplicates.  

2. **HAVING, GROUP BY, AND, IN, Aliasing**  
   Grouped and summarized data using conditions and created clear labels for better readability.  

3. **ORDER BY, LIMIT**  
   Sorted data in ascending or descending order and limited the results to specific subsets.  

4. **Aggregation Functions: MIN(), MAX(), AVG()**  
   Analyzed numerical data by finding minimum, maximum, and average values for key insights.  

5. **COUNT(), ROUND()**  
   Counted occurrences of values and adjusted precision for improved clarity in results.  

6. **CASE-WHEN-THEN**  
   Applied conditional logic to create dynamic columns and categorized data effectively.  

7. **Joins and Its Types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)**  
   Combined data from multiple tables to create unified datasets for detailed analysis.  

8. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Views**  
   Simplified complex queries and created reusable, temporary or permanent data structures for ongoing use.  

9. **Subqueries**  
   Nested queries within larger queries to dynamically filter or compute results.  

10. **Window Functions: RANK(), PARTITION BY**  
    Enabled advanced calculations across specific partitions of data without aggregating them.
